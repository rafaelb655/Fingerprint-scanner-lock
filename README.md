# Fingerprint-scanner-lock☝️
# Project Overview🔆
The purpose of this projects aims to develop a secure and convenient door access system that uses biometric fingerprint recognition for authentication. In doing so the door will be securely locked denying any entrance unless biometrically authenticated. 
# Desired Outcomes🥇
1. Security: System should provide a high level of security through fingerprint recognition, ensuring authorized users can access door.
2. Convenience: Users should experience smooth and fast unlocking process, along with an intuitive system that demonstrates clear feedback with the user interface.
3. Environmental: The system should operate efficiently on battery power, allowing for a long battery life with little power consumption, thus reducing the amount of battery disposal needed.
4. Reliability: The locking system swill be able to withstand regular usage by the user and the environmental conditions presented upon it.
