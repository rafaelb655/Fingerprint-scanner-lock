# Fingerprint-scanner-lock‚òùÔ∏è
# Project OverviewüîÜ
The purpose of this projects aims to develop a secure and convenient door access system that uses biometric fingerprint recognition for authentication. In doing so the door will be securely locked denying any entrance unless biometrically authenticated. 
# Desired Outcomesü•á
1. Security: System should provide a high level of security through fingerprint recognition, ensuring authorized users can access door.
2. Convenience: Users should experience smooth and fast unlocking process, along with an intuitive system that demonstrates clear feedback with the user interface.
3. Environmental: The system should operate efficiently on battery power, allowing for a long battery life with little power consumption, thus reducing the amount of battery disposal needed.
4. Reliability: The locking system swill be able to withstand regular usage by the user and the environmental conditions presented upon it.
5. Regulations/Compliance: The system will meet relevant security and safety standards for door locks and biometric systems, ensuring that the data is protected from breaches.
# Project Deliverablesüì¶
1. Design Document:Contains documentation on block diagrams, major components, moving parts, priorities, component selection.
2. Archetecture/Design: Includes detailed drawings, electrical schematics,PCB layout on hoW the biometric locking system will be created and visually represented.
3. Firmware: Includes microcontroller code that will drive the locking system.
4. Prototypes: 3D printed models of the locking system to test for functionality and validation.
5. Testing/Validation: Extensive testing on locking system to ensure that all standards and requirements are met. As well as to fix any potential bugs or glitches in the system. 
# Future DevelopementüîÆ
- Solar Charging: Ability to recharge the battery source using solar power energy.
- App connectivity: Ability to connect to the locking system through an app from anywhere around the world
- Threat detection services: Ability to detect threats and alert the authorities
