# Microcontroller Design Decision

For the fingerprint scanner lock project, I considered several microcontrollers based on their processing power, memory, communication capabilities, and power consumption. After evaluating the options, I decided to use the **Arduino Nano Every (ATmega4809)**.

## Microcontrollers Considered:

### 1. ESP32
**Pros:**
- Dual-core processor and built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, making it highly versatile.
- Large memory capacity (520 KB SRAM).
- Multiple communication options (UART, I2C, SPI).

**Cons:**
- Higher power consumption.
- More complex development environment compared to Arduino.

**Conclusion:**  
While powerful, the ESP32 was overqualified for this project, particularly for basic local control tasks that don’t require wireless connectivity. Its power consumption and complexity also outweighed its benefits.

### 2. Arduino Nano (ATmega328P)
**Pros:**
- Low cost and familiar development environment.
- Strong community support.
- Sufficient for basic I/O tasks and communication.

**Cons:**
- Limited memory and processing power for handling fingerprint data.
- Fewer communication options compared to more advanced microcontrollers.

**Conclusion:**  
Though a popular option, the ATmega328P was insufficient in terms of memory and processing for this fingerprint-based project.

### 3. Arduino Nano Every (ATmega4809)
**Pros:**
- Improved performance over the original Nano, with more memory (48 KB Flash, 6 KB SRAM).
- 20 MHz clock speed, offering better performance for handling fingerprint sensor data.
- Multiple communication interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C), and additional GPIO pins for peripheral control.
- Low power consumption, suitable for battery-powered systems.
- Backward compatibility with the Arduino ecosystem.

**Cons:**
- Lacks built-in wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) but can be expanded with external modules.

**Conclusion:**  
The Nano Every strikes a balance between performance, memory, and ease of development. Its improved specs over the original Nano make it well-suited for this project while remaining power-efficient and simple to integrate with various peripherals.

## Microcontroller Chosen: **Arduino Nano Every (ATmega4809)**
The Arduino Nano Every was chosen for its balance of sufficient processing power and memory, as well as its compatibility with the Arduino ecosystem. Its low power consumption is ideal for battery-operated devices, and its simplicity ensures that the project remains efficient without unnecessary complexity.

## Resource Plan for the Microcontroller

The following resources of the Arduino Nano Every will be utilized for the fingerprint scanner lock:

### GPIO Pins:
- **Fingerprint Sensor:** The sensor will communicate via the UART interface, using two GPIO pins for the RX and TX lines.
- **Lock Mechanism (Servo Motor):** The locking mechanism will be controlled by a servo motor. The control signal for the servo will be provided through one of the PWM-enabled GPIO pins.
- **LCD Display (1602):** The 1602 LCD module will provide visual feedback to the user, displaying messages such as "Place Finger," "Access Granted," or "Access Denied." It requires several GPIO pins for communication:
  - **4-Bit Mode:** To conserve pins, the LCD will be connected in 4-bit mode, using six GPIO pins: four for data lines (D4–D7) and two for control lines (RS and E).
  - **Optional I2C Module:** If pin availability is limited, an I2C backpack module can be added to the LCD, reducing the required pin count to just two (SDA and SCL).

### PWM Generation:
- **Servo Motor Control:** The Arduino Nano Every will use its PWM capabilities to control the servo motor, which will actuate the lock mechanism. The PWM signal will set the angle of the servo arm, locking or unlocking the door depending on the duty cycle.

### Power Management:
- To conserve power, especially in battery-operated configurations, the Nano Every will use sleep modes during idle times and only wake up when the fingerprint sensor is triggered. This will extend battery life, ensuring the system remains efficient in low-power environments.

## PWM Signal Configuration
- **Timer:** The ATmega4809 features several hardware timers, which will be used to generate the PWM signals.
- **Duty Cycle:** The duty cycle will be adjusted depending on the peripheral in use. For example, the servo motor controlling the lock will require a duty cycle which still needs to be determined.
- **Frequency:** The servo motor requires a 50 Hz PWM signal.

## Conclusion
The **Arduino Nano Every** was chosen because it meets the requirements for processing power, memory, and GPIO availability for handling the fingerprint sensor, the locking mechanism, and the display module. Its ease of use and low power consumption make it a great fit for the fingerprint scanner lock project, and the PWM and UART resources will be utilized effectively for control and communication. By using 4-bit mode or an I2C backpack, the LCD display will provide user feedback while conserving GPIO pins. This setup ensures that all components are efficiently managed, while maintaining a user-friendly interface through the LCD display.
